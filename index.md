## Welcome to Swing Low Strings
My name is Trav Short. I play the upright bass. I love coffee, my cat, riding my bike, and a fine sense of humour. I moved from Edmonton to Victoria in 2008 and started work at Larsen Music where I began learning string instrument repair from Laura Wallace and Galen Hartley. In 2010, I took over as the head of repairs and sales in the string department. Since then I have spent my days repairing hundreds of instruments from our customers and from our rental fleet where I have gained invaluable experience in setup refinement and structural repair. 2017 marks the retirement of John Larsen and Larsen Music. But I shall carry on!  With my experience and with the guidance and generosity over the years from established local luthiers Kim Tipper and Jim Ham, I am confident that I can help you with your string instrument. I provide quality repair at a fair price.
